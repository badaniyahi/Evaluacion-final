ronmental awareness require

refineries to produce clean,
high-octane gasoline products. The
octane number or RON is primarily
the knock resistance measure of gas-
oline. It has a numerical value from
0 to 100 and primarily describes the
behaviour of the fuel in the engine
during combustion at lower tem-
peratures and speeds. To take RON
values to higher levels, the reform-
ing and light naphtha isomerisation
process became an integral part of
refineries. Light naphtha isomerisa-
tion not only produces high octane
isomerate products but it also takes
care of the latest stringent gasoline
specifications. Isomerisation units
can handle the benzene content of
the gasoline pool and most ben-
zene and its precursors are diverted
to the light naphtha fraction as the
feed to this unit. The isomerisation
unit saturates benzene to cyclohex-
ane. The configuration of an isomer-
isation unit depends on the required
RON value of the gasoline pool.

Overview of a light naphtha
isomerisation unit
Isomerisation and reforming are
processes which help to improve
the octane barrel of the end product
by either converting straight chain
paraffins to their branched isomers
or by changing linear hydrocarbons
into branched alkanes and cyclic
naphthenes which are then par-
tially dehydrogenated to produce
high-octane aromatic hydrocarbons.
Isomerisation reactions are
reversible and mildly exothermic.
Conversion to iso-paraffins does
not reach completion since the
reaction is equilibrium governed.

The presence of other components
in the feed such as benzene and
naphthenes tends to raise the reac-
tion temperature as benzene satu-
ration and naphthene ring opening
are highly exothermic, while low
temperatures favour the conver-
sion of n-paraffins to iso-paraffins.
However, operating at low tem-
peratures will decrease the reac-
tion rate, so to overcome this a very
active catalyst is usually employed.

Light naphtha isomerisation is

evaluated on the basis of the prod-
uct yields and the RON of the
isomerate product. The liquid prod-
uct yield is determined principally
by the extent of hydrocracking
which takes in the isomerisation
unit. Hydrocracking is an undesir-
able side reaction which converts
light naphtha into light hydrocar-
bon gas molecules which are low
RON components. There is an
inbuilt tendency in molecules with
higher molecular number such as
the heptanes and above to crack and
produce undesirable components.
C,+ molecules are diverted to the
CCR unit instead of the isomerisa-
tion unit, and benzene and benzene
precursors help to manage this well.
Figure 1 shows the primary light
naphtha isomerisation reactions.
The isomerisation reaction
enhances the octane values of
straight chain alkanes by isom-
erising the n-pentane (nC, RON
value 62) to iso-pentane (iC, RON
93.5). Other low RON components
like nC, (RON 31) are isomerised
to 2-methylpentane (2MP, RON

RON 76). These 2MP and 3MP
molecules are then isomerised to
2,2-dimethylbutane (22DMB) with a
RON of 94 and 2,3-dimethylbutane
(23DMB) with a RON of 104. Table
1 shows the comparative RON val-
ues of individual components in an
isomerisation unit.

Unit configurations to meet RON
requirements

As isomerisation reactions are in
equilibrium, various methods are
used to push the reactions in the
forward direction. The target RON
desired for the combined isomer-
ate product depends on two cri-
teria, the first being removal of
products from the isomerate stream
and the other recycling low octane
molecules from the product back
to the isomerisation reactors. For
this purpose, the depentaniser and
deisopentaniser are installed. It can
be concluded that, since the isom-

erisation reactions are in equilib-
rium, the product octane number
is defined by the number of sep-
aration units in the process. The
sequence of columns used for sep-
aration of isopentanes or isohex-
anes clubbed with the isomerisation
unit with recycle give benefits on
account of managing the equilib-
rium of the reactions taking place in
the isomerisation unit to maximise
RON. As the benchmark for RON
is increased, there is an increase in
reboiler duties which can be attrib-
uted to the following factors:
e Increase in RON requires a
sharp separation between low and
high-octane molecules due to which
the reboiler load of the column
increases.
e RON can also be increased by
recycling low RON components
back to the reactor, which increases
the reboiler duties of the down-
stream columns.

capex involved in deploying var-
ious columns in the process of
boosting octane makes the techno-
crats in the facility rethink other
options. Also, with facilities that
have already invested in these col-
umns, further enhancement of RON
is always on the table. In this article,
we will be discussing the various
configurations of an isomerisation
unit. Figure 2 shows the typical loca-
tion of an isomerisation unit in a
refinery. The top product from the
naphtha splitter with C, less than
3% is sent to the isomerisation unit.

Typical configurations of
isomerisation units in a refinery
Once-through vs hexane recycle
The simplest isomerisation units are
once-through units. Fresh feed is
sent to a feed pretreatment section
and then passes through a series of
isomerisation reactors after mixing
with hydrogen gas where it comes
into contact with the catalyst. The
reactor effluent is sent to a stabi-
liser column where hydrogen and
light hydrocarbons produced due
to hydrocracking are removed from
the top as off-gas and the isomerate
is removed from the stabiliser bot-
toms. The RON achievable through
these once-through processes is
about 85.

Refineries that want to achieve
RON beyond a value of 85 deploy
ways to recycle low octane mol-
ecules back to the isomerisation
reactor. Facilities which have an
isomerisation reactor followed by
a deisohexaniser (DIH) column can
achieve a product RON of up to 88
by recycling a high percentage of
the n-hexane, 2-methylpentane, and
3-methylpentane, which are low in
RON, back to the reactor.

This is achieved by drawing the
mid-cut from the DIH column. The
DIH produces a light isomerate
distillate product consisting of C,
and branched C, molecules (rich
in DMBs), a C, recycle side draw,
and a C,+ bottoms product. For a
recycle stream at 60% of the fresh
feed, an octane increase of several
points is achieved compared to the
once-through operation. Typically,
one can expect a RON increase
from 83-84 to 87-88 with DIH col-
umn hexane recycle to the isom-

recycle and deisopentanised feed
Some facilities, in addition to a DIH
column with recycle, have a deiso-
pentaniser (DIP) column installed
before the isomerisation reactor.
This helps in achieving an isomer-
ate product of RON up to 90. As
the DIP is placed in a feed fraction-

ation section, it removes iC, from
the feed as overhead distillate prod-
uct, which pushes the reaction in
the forward direction. The balance
of the feed is sent to isomerisation
reactors and the reactor effluent is
sent to a DIH column to separate
high octane C,/C, isomerate prod-
uct from low octane C, molecules
which are recycled to the isomeri-
sation reactor. Thus the addition of
a DIP increases the RON over that
of a ‘DIH only’ configuration (see
Figure 4).

Unconverted n-pentanes with RON
values as low as 61 are sent to the
DIH distillate and thus become a
part of the final isomerate prod-
uct. For full conversion of all nor-
mal paraffins, recycling is required
via a depentaniser (DP) installed
before the DIH column. This helps
to make a_ sharper separation
between the DMB-rich C, isomer-
ate product and the iC,/nC, recycle
stream. The DP column removes
iC,/nC, as an overhead distillate
product upstream of the DIH and
recycles it back to the deisopen-
taniser column, which in turn sep-
arates iC, as the high RON top
product, and nC, is recycled back
to the reactor via bottoms product.
This again helps in pushing the
equilibrium reactions in the for-
ward direction. The configuration
(see Figure 5) improves RON up to
93.

Table 2 shows how the introduc-
tion of DP/DIP/DIH columns in
the isomerisation loop in various
combinations, clubbed with the type
of process employed, impacts the
achievable RON.

Developments in dividing wall
column technology applied to
isomerisation
Advances in distillation play a key
role in minimising the costs of new
and revamped projects in a refin-
ery. Dividing wall column (DWC)
technology had limited acceptance
20 years ago but is now reshaping
our distillation processes. DWC
technology is increasingly used to
modernise conventional distillation
sequences, especially in revamps of
existing units. Besides energy and
throughput improvements, a DWC
revamp significantly improves the
performance of downstream units.
The alignment of the dividing
wall inside the column plays a
dominant role in the selection of
DWC for a particular separation.
The middle DWC is an ideal alter-
native for side cut columns, which
helps to increase throughput and
gives better product specifications.
The top DWC provides an addi-
tional source of heat integration

the other hand, the bottom DWC
has the advantage of replacing a
two-column arrangement in an
indirect sequence.

The latest advance in DWC tech-
nology is dual wall dividing col-
umns which are known to have a
higher thermodynamic efficiency
than their counterparts. From the
outside, it is no different from a
simple DWC but has the capability
to deliver four or more high purity
products from a single column. As
dual wall columns are robust, flex-
ible, and easy to operate, this tech-
nology has become viable. Figure 6
shows the elevations of commonly
used DWCs.

Revamp of a deisohexaniser column
using DWC technology

DWC technology plays a key role
in enhancing the performance of
isomerisation units. Facilities that
want to improve the RON of the
final isomerate find divided wall
column technology lucrative as this
involves only the deisohexaniser
(DIH) column being revamped, so
as to include the additional func-

tionality of DIP or DP columns as
the case may be. Besides enhanc-
ing separation, DWC revamps pro-
vide considerable energy savings
when compared to conventional
distillation column flow schemes.
The use of DWC technology in an
isomerisation unit not only targets
improvement in RON but brings
the added advantage of increased
throughput which would other-
wise require installation of new
columns. The remaining part of
this article focuses on the appli-
cations and outcomes of revamp-
ing the DIH column in various
configurations.

Application of DWC in isomerisation
units with hexane recycle

The DIH column _ recirculates
unbranched molecules, mainly
n-hexanes and  methylpentanes,
after removal of branched, high-
RON molecules back to the isom-
erisation reactor. The top product,
the light isomerate, contains mainly
isopentanes, dimethylbutanes,
and methylpentanes. The less the
amount of methylpentanes going
to the top product, the better the

RON value of the final isomerate.
Although this configuration defi-
nitely gives a higher RON than a
once-through process, the RON can
be further increased by recirculating
methylpentanes back to the reac-
tor. Also, separation of isopentanes
present in the fresh feed going to
the isomerisation reactor contribute
to higher RON values. The isopen-
tanes present in the fresh feed take
a free ride in the isomerisation reac-
tion process and restrict the forward
reaction to produce more branched
chain components. The conven-
tional method for removing isopen-
tanes from fresh feed is to install a
DIP column upstream of the isom-
erisation reactor.

The revamp of an existing DIH
column to a DWC enables it to have
the dual functionality of a deiso-
pentaniser. Hydrotreated naphtha
is first sent to the revamped DIH
column which now produces four
sharp cuts. As Figure 7 shows, the
light/heavy isomerate and the recy-
cle are managed in a way similar to
that before the revamp, while the
fourth cut is the fresh feed to the
isomerisation reactor without iso-

Conclusion

The benefits of DWC technology
have grown beyond reduction
in energy consumption or capex.
Refineries are using DWC _ tech-
nology for maximising revenue
from newer or better products. It is
increasingly used in debottleneck-
ing existing units in the refinery.
Light naphtha isomerisation is one
such example, in which the simple
revamp of a DIH column improves

ing RON along with an increase in

pentanes. This is an attractive and lucrative scheme as
a DWC revamp of a DIH saves the installation of a DIP
column, though offering the same benefits.

The advantage of this revamp is a boost in RON to
90, from 87 previously, along with a fresh feed increase
of 10-20%. Figure 7 compares a conventional DIH to a
post-revamp version converted to a DWC configuration
unit with hexane recycle.

A conventional configuration of an isomerisation
unit with hexane recycle and a DIP column can attain
a RON close to 90 as the presence of the DIP column
helps remove most iC, before the reactor which in turn
affects the reaction equilibrium in the forward direc-
tion. But to achieve RON values beyond this number,
unreacted nC, needs to be recirculated back to the reac-
tor. The DIH column in the conventional configuration
is not able to restrict nC, going to the light isomerate,
hence maximum conversion of nC, to its high-octane
isomer is not achieved. Also, because some portion of
nC, becomes a part of the light isomerate this affects
the RON adversely. By revamping the conventional
DIH column to dividing wall, more of the sharper cuts
can be obtained and the RON of the isomerate can be
improved further.

Figure 8 shows that, to improve the RON of the
final product further, the DIH column is revamped to
a DWC s0 as to draw four cuts from the column. The
light and the heavy isomerate are combined and sent to
the gasoline pool, while the third cut is recycled to the
reactor in a manner similar to the conventional scheme.
The fourth cut drawn from the DIH column primarily
consists of iC, along with unreacted nC, which is recy-
cled back to the DIP column. The deisopentaniser col-
umn removes isopentanes from the fresh feed along
with the recycle stream from the revamped DIH col-
umn. The bottoms of the DIP column are rich in straight
chain components and are routed to the isomerisation
reactor. The revamp of a DIH column in this configura-
tion provides the dual functionality of a DP column and
helps in achieving a RON of 91-93 in the final isomerate
product.

Table 3 summarises the benefits of DWC technology
for various isomerisation configurations.
